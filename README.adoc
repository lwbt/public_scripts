== What is it?

This is a collection of convenience scripts and some other scripts.

== Where is it?

I set up an DNS forward from https://scriptslwbt.ddns.me/ to
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwbt/public_scripts/main/.

It only works with public repositories, private repositories require a token.
