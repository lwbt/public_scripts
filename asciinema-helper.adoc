== Overview

Asciinema has existed for years, but from my point of view and the people I
have met, many know about the Star Wars terminal movie but almost nobody
documents their terminal work with asciinema. So here is my contribution to
change that by making it even easier to use.

MacOS*, Windows and other operating systems are not supported yet. Feel free to
port the functionality to your platform and preferred language, extend this
scripts' compatibility or tell me of any existing projects so I can link them
here.

Why Bash? I would have preferred to write all my new code in Python instead,
but I have to put this endeavor on hold until I have cleaned up other areas
with technical debt. I try to write concise Bash code. If I continue to write
messy code in other languages my problems will only get worse.

*Before implementing this script in a more complicated way that works with very
old versions of Bash, I'll let someone else with more experience of Macs with
homebrew decide what is best to make it work.
